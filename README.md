# Vrinda Store Annual Report 2022
This repository contains the files and documentation for the Vrinda Store Annual Report for the year 2022. The objective of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior and identify strategies to increase sales in the year 2023.

<h3>Objective</h3>

The main objective of the Vrinda Store Annual Report is to analyze customer data from the year 2022 and utilize the findings to improve sales in the upcoming year. By understanding customer preferences, identifying trends, and addressing areas of improvement, Vrinda Store aims to enhance its sales strategies and drive business growth.

<h3>Process Overview</h3>

The project consists of the following key steps:  
1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was thoroughly examined to ensure accuracy and consistency. In the gender field, redundant entries such as "Male," "M," "Female," and "F" were addressed. Similarly, redundant entries in the quantity field like "1," "one," "2," and "two" were resolved.
2. **Data Processing:** Age groups or brackets were applied to categorize customers based on their age. Additionally, a new column was created to extract the month from the date field. This enables month-level analysis and facilitates answering specific questions related to sales patterns across different months.
3. **Data Analysis:** Pivot tables were utilized to summarize and analyze the data. Key analyses conducted include:
  - Monthly Analysis: Pivot tables were created to showcase the total sales amount and quantity sold for each month. 
  - Sales by Gender: Separate pivot tables were created to examine sales amounts for men and women. 
  - Order Status Analysis: Pivot tables were used to analyze the count of order IDs based on different order statuses.
  - Top Sales States: A pivot table was constructed to identify the top 10 sales states.
  - Age Group Analysis: Pivot tables were utilized to analyze the count of order IDs for different age groups, categorized by gender.
  - Channel Analysis: Pivot tables were created to analyze the count of order IDs based on different channels.
4. **Data visualization:**
